    "description": "Launched as the Suede All Star in the early 1970s, this model is often  referred to as the Jack Star, and although it's made sporadic  appearances in the Converse catalogue since, it has always been  overshadowed by the Chuck Taylor, the Jack Purcell, and the original One  Star. Recently elements of the under-appreciated model formed the basis  for Anthony Pappalardo's signature skate shoe, but after parting ways  with Converse&nbsp;that seems destined for obscurity too. Now dubbed the One  Star Academy, this version, produced exclusively for Inventory, is a  leather-lined, tonal suede interpretation of the original with a white  debossed license plate. It is available in limited numbers, and in two  simple colours.&nbsp;\u2022 Converse for Inventory\u2022 First String Release\u2022 Athletic Navy Suede\u2022 Leather Lining\u2022 US Sizing",
